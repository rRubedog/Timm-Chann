                    !DRAFT! <br> <br>
                    I have learned a lot about the great ouroboros conflict; morality vs the bigger
                    picture. <br>
                    The idea of this type of conflict is in itself a very hard debate to settle.  
                    Weather to settle on moral values with the price of a future possibility, or
                    to settle on an idea that supports the future and what can be.  This is a very
                    hard question, and yet a very reacurring question. <br>
                    A great example of one of these conflicts comes in the form of marvel.
                    Spesifically the story of Kang, Kang is basically a man who made himself a 
                    god through time travel and his great ability to conquer.  The great conflict
                    that Kang attends to as his variant 'He Who Remains' is either let the people
                    of his timeline have complete free will and risk the destruction and litteral
                    end of everything.  Or he can manage the timeline and prevent any further 
                    branches to ensure that no encursions or multivursal wars happen.  With the 
                    second option, he has to prune-obliterate-the branches, essentially killing 
                    a quadrillion people within seconds (not the morally correct answer).  With
                    the first option, he gives anyone and everyone freewill and dosen't have to
                    kill anyone (the morally correct answer) although this does ensure that the 
                    entire multiverse can end.
